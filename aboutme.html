   <p>Hello. How are you? Doing well I presume. My name is Breana. I live at home with my family including my five pets, my two dogs Bently and Harley, my two hamsters Emry and Dwayne, and my turtle Frank. School, softball, and spending time with my family are the most important things in my life. They push me to strive to be better and succeed even in hard time. Some of my hobbies include softball, reading, and building relationships with friends.
